        <p>
            Github is a website for developers and creators alike to upload and share their code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Github has a very interactive system. A registered user can download 'git' on their machine of choice<br> 
            and be able to upload projects from a multitude of ways. The way I, Billy Rintamaki prefer to use is via<br> 
            Windows Powershell. Other ways of uploading projects are via the Github Desktop app. And via Direct Upload to the website.<br> 
            This website is such a powerful tool because it allows users to not only get an understanding of how someone created something.<br> 
            But the website can be used almost as a wikipedia for coding. I myself have used Github to piece code together to make a script for a<br> 
            game work as intended.
        </p>

        <p>
            Github has been used for a lot of programmers as sort of a first hand reference of their past work.
        </p>

        <p>I intend to upload all my work to Github this semester as a way of seeing how much I've improved.</p>
