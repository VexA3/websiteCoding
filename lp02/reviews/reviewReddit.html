        <h2>Billy's Review of Reddit.com</h2>

        <p>Reddit.com is a website known for being 'The front page of the internet'. If you can think of a community, theres one on reddit.com</p>

        <p>Reddit is a great website! It is super useful for looking up ideas, asking for help, or just surfing for entertainment. I use reddit for those exact reasons.
            Reddit harbors threads filled with questionable topics, but that is expected from a website with millions and millions of communities and threads.
            The UI for reddit is above average. It is particularly nice because of its searching system. Reddit's searching system is kind of like a mix of 
            Google search and Xenforo. Being able to searh for a community or idea like its google, then have threads and communities pop up like a Xenforo forum is great!

            Reddit does use fragment identifiers. on the FAQ page specificly, each FAQ hyper link uses a specific id.
