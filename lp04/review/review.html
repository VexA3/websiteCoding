        <h2>Review of CSS Zengarden</h2>

        <p>
            On the CSS Zengarden website, there are lots of different examples of how much CSS can improve your website.
            On the example site labeled A Robot Named Jimmy. The website uses CSS to have a static background. But while you
            scroll,
            the background changes. For each seperate chunk of information has a different background and an image to go
            along with it.
            I notice that there are many different paragraphs with their own Header while being separated by being side by
            side. This is
            a really nice touch as it compresses the overall length of the page without inhibiting the design.

        <p>
            On the page, Mid Century Modern, the page has lots of color and boxes with images. Each box is different in its
            own way.
            This is a nice touch because this page has the same background and paragraph splitting as the last page. One
            outstanding feature
            that the last page didn't have is that this page has a box that stretches across multiple background changes.
            This is very unique
            and stands out nicely with the design. Continuing down the page, there are background changes similar to the
            last page. The difference is
            this page has boxes that overlay overtop of the background image with a unique header, being on along the left
            side of the paragraph it is assigned to.
            At the bottom of the page, there is a unique design for selecting more pages. There are 4 boxes, all different
            colors but each shares 2 different links along with the author.
            Although the design looks nice for this page. The usability of it in my opinion is lacking. it is hard to defer
            the difference between a button or just a box with text.
