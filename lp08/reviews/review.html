        <h2>Amazon</h2>
        
        <p>Amazon is basically an online shoping mall...</p>

        <p>
            When you search for anything on amazon's website for purchasing. The list of items that shows up is an example of a tabular design.
            In my opinion, there isn't much else to say about amazon's website. Anyone who is of age has seen or used the page.
