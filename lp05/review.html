             <p>
                 Battlemetrics is an Rcon website used for game servers. It is one of many ways of allowing multiple server admins to access the server chat logs.
                 Battlemetrics has a very capable API that allows for people to use in HTML. This is great because it allows people to create scripts in HTML which can link to Javascript that can do what ever you need it to do.
                 Weather that be kicking someone for an offensive word, or checking statistics of the server its self. Creating a module to show how many players are online, or how many admins are online.
