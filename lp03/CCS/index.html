                <h2>Competative Cup Stacking</h2>
    
                <p>In this new Olympic sport, atheletes will compete in two categories.</p>
    
                <br>
        
                <h3>Tallest Stacked Cup Monument</h3>
        
                <p>
                    This is a team event where teams of at least 2, but no more than 5 athletes will join forces to build the tallest stacked cup monument. 
                    Standard-issued plastic cups of varied colors will be provided. No additional tools, including ladders, can be used. 
                    The structure must stand without any additional support for 3 minutes to be considered as a medal winning monument.
                </p>
                    
                <br>
    
                <h3>Fastest Stack</h3>
        
                <p>
                    Individuals will be competing in a timed cup stacking event. All individuals are competing in one bracket. 
                    Athletes will be given 144 standard-issues plastic cups of varied colors to use. 
                    The top 3 athletes to construct and de-construct the structure using all plastic cups without issue will be awarded medals.
