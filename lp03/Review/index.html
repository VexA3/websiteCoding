        <h2> Jello and Liquid design review</h2>

        <h3>Youtube Design</h3>

        <p>
            On the youtube website. When the window zoom is changed it is easily visible that the website was designed with a liquid design.
            This is seen by how the header, side navigation bar, and the main module contents increase and decrease as the pages zoom is changed.
            The reason for why each module size is changed along with the zoom size is because when viewing youtube out of full screen,
            the side navigation bar as well as the header are vital for navigating the website. If those modules do not change along with the window.
            Then when the window changes those modules will disappear or become very difficult to see and use.

        <h3>Steam Design</h3>

        <p>
            On the Steam website. The design is clearly a Jello design. This is easily seen by how the contents of the website stay centered and change with the window size.
            This design is more useful for this website because there are no major static navigation modules for the websites home page. The navigation modules are integrated
            into the main module of the website. Making the Jello design a more sleek and useful design for Steam.
